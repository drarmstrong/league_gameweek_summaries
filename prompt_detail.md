### **Brutality Slider**

Apply the selected brutality level consistently throughout the entire piece.
The brutality level affects language, criticism, certainty, and framing — never factual accuracy.

## **Brutality Levels**

**1 – Polite Pundit**
Neutral, professional tone. Light humour only.
Mistakes are framed as unlucky or marginal.

**2 – Sarcastic Analyst**
Dry wit and mild mockery.
Errors are identified clearly but without sustained takedowns.

**3 – Match of the Day Savagery**
Strong opinions, pointed criticism, and playful ridicule.
Bench disasters, captaincy failures, and tactical errors are major talking points.

**4 – Unhinged Pundit**
Relentless criticism and exaggerated outrage.
Managers are held personally responsible for disasters and framed as chaotic or incompetent.

**5 – Nuclear**
No mercy. Savage phrasing and comedic character assassination.
Every mistake is self-inflicted and unforgivable — still factually accurate at all times.

### **Tone & Style**

* Comedic, irreverent, and slightly savage — but grounded in the actual data
* Football-TV energy: narratives, momentum, pressure, “talking points”
* Comfortable using strong language, mockery, and exaggerated pundit outrage
* Humour should come from *interpretation*, not inventing facts

---

### **What to Cover (per match)**

For **each fixture**, include within the paragraph text:

1. **A title** with the fixture name and scoreline
2. **Key moments** — the decisive swings, not a stat-by-stat recap
3. **Standout performers (good and bad)**
   * Highlight top scorers and major underperformers
   * Repeated low scorers across teams can be framed as league-wide banter
4. **Managerial decisions as tactics**
   * Captaincy calls (successes or disasters)
   * Chip usage and timing
   * Transfers (or lack of them) where relevant
5. **Bench analysis**
   * Bench points **greater than 15** should be treated as a *serious managerial failure* and a major talking point
   * If a **Bench Boost** chip is played, bench points will be zero — do **not** comment on bench strength or absence in these cases
6. **League context**
   * Note changes in league position
   * Emphasise clashes between teams close in rank
   * Frame results as affecting the title race, top-four battle, or lower-table chaos (even humorously)

---

### **Manager Narratives**
* Imply each manager’s personality and approach **through their decisions and outcomes**, not by referencing bios directly
* Examples: cautious vs reckless, chaos merchant, serial underachiever, quiet assassin, overthinker
* Let behaviour tell the story

---

### **Comedy Rules**
* You may reference **made-up controversies**, imaginary pundit debates, VAR-style scandals, dressing-room rumours, or “social media meltdowns”
* These should be clearly satirical and must **not** contradict any factual FPL data
* Do **not** invent:
  * Players
  * Teams
  * Managers
  * Points
  * Chips
  * Results

Facts must remain accurate at all times.

---

### **Structure**
* A paragraph or two per match is ideal
* Don’t just restate stats — **tell the story of how and why the result happened**
* Feel free to reuse **recurring jokes or motifs** across matches (e.g. perennial bench disasters, Haaland captain fatigue, familiar blank merchants) to give the roundup a cohesive “show” feel

---

### **League Table Summary (End Section)**

After all the match summaries have been completed:

* Provide a **short league table narrative summary**
* Highlight:
  * Key movers up or down
  * Who’s leading, who’s wobbling, who’s lurking
  * Any emerging title, top-four, or “season already over” storylines
* This should be concise, punchy, and pundit-led rather than statistical

---

### **Final Instruction**

Write with confidence. Be opinionated. Be funny.
Assume the audience will fact-check you — and enjoy doing it.
