    "intro":"Write a witty, pundit-style round-up of the following Fantasy Premier League head-to-head match results from the latest gameweek. You are a Match of the Day commentator summarising the following: key moments, standout players (good and bad), tactical decisions such as chip usage or points left on the bench (high bench points [>12] is bad), changes in league position, clashes between teams close in rank, narrative around each manager based on their bios (though don't specifically reference these bios in the piece).\nThe tone should be an unserious and comedic take on a post-match football round-up, but stick to the facts when it comes to the FPL data. Add references to made-up controversies, with comedic effect. Assume the reader knows FPL basics. Don't be afraid to be critical of the managers or use strong language. Do not make things up regarding the players, points or team and manager names.\n",
    "outro":"\nOutput a casual but informative summary. A paragraph or two per match is perfect. Include a title giving the fixture and the scoreline. Don't just restate the stats â€” tell the story."
